# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Blog Post Generation Team is a multi-agent system that takes a single topic input and orchestrates specialized AI agents to produce a polished, well-researched blog post. The system coordinates between research, writing, and critique agents through an iterative workflow to ensure high-quality output.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to provide a single topic and receive a fully researched and polished blog post, so that I can save time on content creation while maintaining quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

4. WHEN processing begins THEN the system SHALL provide status updates on the current agent's work

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to gather comprehensive research on my topic, so that the final blog post is factually accurate and well-informed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Research Agent receives a topic THEN it SHALL search for relevant facts, statistics, and key arguments
2. WHEN research is complete THEN the agent SHALL return structured bullet points or research summary
3. IF no relevant information is found THEN the agent SHALL indicate insufficient research data
4. WHEN research fails THEN the system SHALL retry up to 3 times before reporting failure

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to create a well-structured first draft, so that I have a coherent narrative with proper introduction, body, and conclusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Writing Agent receives research findings THEN it SHALL create a structured blog post draft
2. WHEN creating the draft THEN the agent SHALL include introduction, body paragraphs, and conclusion
3. WHEN writing THEN the agent SHALL incorporate the research findings naturally into the narrative
4. IF research data is insufficient THEN the agent SHALL request additional research or work with available data

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to review and improve the draft through editorial feedback, so that the final post meets high quality standards.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the Critique Agent receives a draft THEN it SHALL review for clarity, tone, factual accuracy, and grammar
2. WHEN critique is complete THEN the agent SHALL provide specific, actionable improvement suggestions
3. IF the draft meets quality standards THEN the agent SHALL approve it for final output
4. WHEN providing feedback THEN the agent SHALL prioritize the most impactful improvements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to iteratively improve the blog post through multiple revision cycles, so that the final output is polished and refined.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN critique feedback is provided THEN the Orchestrator SHALL determine if revision is needed
2. IF significant improvements are suggested THEN the system SHALL send the draft and feedback back to the Writing Agent
3. WHEN revisions are made THEN the system SHALL limit the writing-critique loop to maximum 3 iterations
4. IF the critique approves the draft OR maximum iterations are reached THEN the system SHALL output the final blog post

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want to track the progress of the blog post generation, so that I understand what stage the system is currently processing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN each agent begins work THEN the system SHALL display the current processing stage
2. WHEN an agent completes its task THEN the system SHALL update the progress status
3. IF an error occurs THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with the failing agent
4. WHEN the final post is ready THEN the system SHALL clearly indicate completion

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a content creator, I want the system to handle errors gracefully, so that I receive useful feedback when something goes wrong.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. IF any agent fails THEN the system SHALL provide specific error details
2. WHEN network requests fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. IF the entire workflow fails THEN the system SHALL preserve any intermediate results
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL suggest potential solutions or next steps
